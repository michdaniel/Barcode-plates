# Barcode-plates
Template script for generating barcoding plate layouts. 

The purpose of this script is to generate 2 csv files:
1. For Marvin: This should tell Marvin how much volume of each metal to pipette into each well of the final barcoding plates. Should contain essentially four fields specifying the following: origin plate, origin plate well, target plate, target plate well and volume. 

2. For debarcoding: This should specify which metals are present in each well for each final barcode plate. 

This template is for 252 well BC but can be modified to create other plae formats. 
Sections indicated with "!!!!" need to be input or adapted by the user.
